# Frontend-Nanodegree - Feed-Reader-Project

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The case is writing test suites according to given expectations.

My task was to implement a series of test sets using JavaScript Testing Framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to check the application logic, event handling and DOM manipulation. I added my tests to `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.
